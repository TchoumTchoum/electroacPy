The aim of this chapter is to provide users with detailed information, enabling them to utilize the toolbox to its full potential. The first section covers the **circuitSolver** class, which is used to build electro-acoustic lumped circuits. From there, we will explore the lumped-element modeler and, finally, the boundary element classes.
