# Back-end

<!---
The aim of this chapter is to provide users with detailed information, enabling them to utilize the toolbox to its full potential. The first section covers the **circuitSolver** class, which is used to build electro-acoustic lumped circuits. From there, we will explore the lumped-element modeler and, finally, the boundary element classes.

This chapter aims to provide basic information about the functioning of electroacPy. The goal is not to give a detailed explanation of how each function works but to offer an overview of how systems are solved --- covering the solving of electro-mechano-acoustical circuits, the modeling of loudspeakers and enclosures, and the fundamentals of using bempp-cl for loudspeaker simulation.
